#   'UbuntuMono Nerd Font Mono'
#   'Hack Nerd Font Mono'

# Fonts to try:
#   Iosevka
#   Iosevka Comfy
#   Inconsolata
#
# Note:
#   As of 11/11/2024, the 0xProto font from nerd fonts was using a fairly
#   outdated version of the font (it was missing italics, eg). There is a PR
#   to update it, but it hasn't merged yet. So I build the "Nerd Font" version
#   myself using their fontforge tool.
#   I did the same with Lilex.
