# What is this directory?

This is for my custom tmux config which is based on [this config](https://github.com/olimorris/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/tmux/conf/skin.conf).

I would like to be able to load it like a normal tmux plugin without having to publish,
but I'm not sure there's a way to do that.

The theme.tmux and color.tmuxtheme files are leftover from an attempt to get that to work,
but alas it did not. Leaving theme as a reminder of what I have tried.
