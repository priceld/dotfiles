# Introduction
This, as you may have already guessed, is my personal dotfiles repo. It has
taken inspiration from many different places (see [References](#references)).

It currently only supports MacOS, which is my daily driver for work. When
setting up a new computer, just clone the repo and run:
```shell
$ ./setup-macos.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```


# Improvements
This is very much a work in progress and there's lots that could be improved such as:

* Check in my favorite fonts (git-lfs?)
* Use git bare repo instead of `stow`?
