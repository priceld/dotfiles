# Introduction

This, as you may have already guessed, is my personal dotfiles repo. It has
taken inspiration from many different places (see [References](#references)).

It currently only supports MacOS, which is my daily driver for work. When
setting up a new computer, just clone the repo and run:

```shell
$ ./setup-macos.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```

# Improvements

This is very much a work in progress and there's lots that could be improved such as:

- Check in my favorite fonts (git-lfs?)
- Or store large files (fonts, icons, etc) in some other cloud storage?
- Use git bare repo instead of `stow`?

Here are some extensive dotfiles that I've only begun scratching the surface of. They
seem really cool/useful:
